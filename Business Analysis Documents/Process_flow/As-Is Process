# As-Is Process Flow

1. New employees receive basic onboarding without formal mentorship.  
2. Employee feedback is collected sporadically and informally.  
3. Career development paths are unclear and inconsistently supported.  
4. Attrition data is tracked but not deeply analyzed.  
5. Communication on retention efforts is irregular and limited.
